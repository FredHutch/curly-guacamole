# Development

  - Precise tasks depend on the need
  - Adding new hosts to existing roles- just bootstrap
  - A new application- develop a new role
  - Extending or changing an existing role?
    - Update the role or library cookbooks
    - Rev the cookbook
    - Update the environment, indicate the new role version

# Closing Notes

  - This is a significant change in how we do business
  - In the words of Haagrid: "Yer a developer, 'arry"
  - Stop thinking of isolated changes, rather releases
  - Think about collaboration with application devs
    - Think about handing off management to application devs!
