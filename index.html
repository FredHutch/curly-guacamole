# Chef Development Workflow 

---
# Policy objects

 - role + cookbooks + environment = policy

## Role

Roles define:

  - attributes
  - run list\*

## Environment

Environments define:

  - attributes
  - cookbook versions\*

---

# Policy Objects

  - Role defines the cookbook(s) to be used
  - Environment defines the version of a cookbook to use

  > Versioning is important because different versions of a cookbook
  > may have different features and capabilities

  > This is particularly critical when using 3rd party (i.e. community)
  > cookbooks as we don't control releases

  > _N.B.:_ A node may have multiple roles!

---
# Cookbook Patterns

## _role cookbook_ pattern

  - the _role_ object is defined on the server with only the _role recipe_'s
    default recipe in the run list
  - the _role recipe_ runs additional recipes as necessary to configure the
    components for the role

## _environment cookbook_ pattern

  - Defines dependencies only on role cookbooks
  - Used to resolve cookbook dependencies within an environment
  - `Berksfile.lock` is checked into SCM

  > This is important- by checking in a working lock file you can
  > revert to a previous environment should something break

---
# Role Cookbooks

---
# Environment Cookbook Development

## Environment Branches

  - Each branch has a corresponding environment on the server
  - An environment cookbook `scicomp-env-compute` with branches `prod` and
    `dev`, there would have these environment objects on the Chef server:

     - `scicomp-env-compute` (the `prod` branch doesn't get a suffix)
     - `scicomp-env-compute-dev`

---

# Environment Cookbook Development

  - The environment cookbook has only a `metadata.rb` file containing
    the role cookbooks that will operate inside this environment

## Example

  - Assume one environment for database servers and another for web servers
  - The *database* environment would have roles:
    - base
    - db\_server
  - The *web* environment would have roles:
    - base
    - apache
    - nginx

> The base role has rules common to any host.  Though note that the database
> and web environments could use different versions of the base role cookbook.

---

# Environment Cookbook Development

`scicomp-env-database/metadata.rb`:

```
name 'scicomp-env-database'
version '0.1.0'

depends 'scicomp-role-base', '= 1.0.2'
depends 'scicomp-role-db_server', '= 2.1.7'
```

`scicomp-env-web/metadata.rb`:

```
name 'scicomp-env-web'
version '0.5.2'

depends 'scicomp-role-base', '= 0.9.5'
depends 'scicomp-role-apache', '= 4.0.1'
depends 'scicomp-role-nginx', '= 2.2.3'
```

# The Berkshelf Way

`berkshelf` manages cookbook dependencies, allows liberal use of 3rd party
cookbooks without losing one's sanity

  - Using community cookbooks quickly leads to dependency hell
  - Declare dependencies and let `berks` sort out which versions are required

---

# Basic `Berksfile`:

  - created by `chef generate cookbook`

```
source 'https://supermarket.chef.io'

metadata
```
  - indicates url of a server running the supermarket API
  - indicates that dependencies are located in the `metadata.rb` file

---

# Berks-ing

## Building the Lockfile

  - `Berksfile.lock` is a file containing a graph indicating cookbooks and
    versions required
  - `berks install` and `berks update` create and manage the file

## Updating the Chef Server

  - `berks upload` uploads the cookbook version to the server and freezes it
  - `berks apply <environment>` applies the versions to the environment

---

# What Berks is Managing

  ![:scale 100%](img/graph.png)

> This graph is generated by `berks viz`, using `graphviz` as the back-end for
> creating the image

---

# Working with Chef

  - The exact steps depend on the need

## New Hosts

  - Adding new hosts to existing roles- just bootstrap

        `knife bootstrap --run-list role[cit-base] ...`

---

## New Applications

  - Create a role that configures _just_ the application
  - Rely on base roles to configure the basic stuff

## Changes to Existing Roles

  - Update the cookbook(s) and check in changes
  - Rev the cookbook and create a release
  - Update the environment with the new role version
  - Deploy the environment

---
# Automation

Most of what I've described needs automating to keep us from making mistakes.

## Cookbooks

  - Jenkins does testing and cookbook uploads
  - Multibranch job "builds" each branch
    - Basic validation (`foodcritic` and `rubocop`)
    - All of the berks steps
  - Check the "automatic-garbanzo" github project

---

## Environments

  - Automation is still a work in progress
  - Rakefile examines each branch and applies environment using berks

---
# Closing Notes

![harry](img/hagrid.jpg)

  - Think like a developer...
  - No more isolated changes, rather releases
  - Think about collaboration with application devs
    - Think about handing off management to application devs!
